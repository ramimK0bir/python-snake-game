## How to Play

* The snake moves continuously on the grid.
* Eat the food (represented by the food emoji) to grow longer and increase your score.
* Avoid hitting the walls or the snake's own body.
* The game ends if you collide with yourself or the grid edges.
* Use invisible_wall=True to pass through grid edges.
* Your current score is displayed above the grid.

## Notes

* The game uses ANSI escape codes for terminal control (clear screen, colors).
* Works best on terminals supporting Unicode and ANSI colors.
